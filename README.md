## Usage

This website is divided into different sections. The header of the website includes the title, logo and a navigation bar. Within the body section of the website, there is a search bar where the user could look up a plant name. Once a name is clicked on or searched, information in regards to the plant will show up such as their scientific names, any other names they go by, information on their watering cycle, and the amount of sunlight that plant needs. A picture of the plant will also pop up next to the information. The bottom of the website contains a list of all of the user's saved searches which is saved and displayed using local storage. If the user clicks on the locations button on the navigation bar, the plant information will disappear and a map will display. The user could input a location within the search bar and all the plant stores near that location will pop up with a leaf marker. The user could then click on the different markers to find out the address of the plant shop. All of the select plant shops will be added to a list on the side of the map. The perenual API was used to get all of the plant information and to complete the autocomplete widget on the search bar. The map used in the location feature is tied with google maps API.
